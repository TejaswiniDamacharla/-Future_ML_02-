# -Future_ML_02-
 # üìÅ Dataset
Source: Kaggle / Telecom or Banking Customer Churn Dataset
Dataset: Telco-Customer-Churn.csv (or equivalent)
This dataset contains customer information including demographics, account information, services used, and whether they churned or stayed.
# ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Followed
1. Data Preparation
Load the dataset in Google Colab.
Explore the dataset: shape, data types, missing values.
Handle missing or inconsistent data (TotalCharges conversion, etc.).
Extract/convert features as needed (e.g., categorical to numeric).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Countplot of churn to check class distribution.
Visualize customer demographics, tenure, contract types, and payment methods.
Identify correlations between features and churn.
3. Data Preprocessing
Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, contract, payment method).
Scale numerical features if required.
Split data into train and test sets.
4. Model Building
Train classification models to predict churn.
Models used:
Logistic Regression (baseline model)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
5. Model Evaluation
Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.
Visualize confusion matrix and performance comparisons between models.
6. Feature Importance
Identify most important features contributing to churn:
Contract type
Monthly charges
Tenure
Internet service usage
Plot feature importance for interpretability.
7. Insights & Recommendations
Highlight patterns from EDA (e.g., long-tenure customers rarely churn, month-to-month contracts are high risk).
Suggest targeted interventions to reduce churn.
8. Cross-Validation
Perform k-fold cross-validation to ensure model stability.
Report mean accuracy and standard deviation.
# ‚úÖ Bonus
Implemented XGBoost for improved accuracy.
Achieved robust predictions and reliable feature importance rankings.
